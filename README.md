## Voting system


This project was a solution to the challenge proposed on [GitHub repository](https://github.com/backend-br/desafios/blob/master/points-of-interest/PROBLEM.md), where the goal was to create a service that would
return points (coordinates) near a point and a maximum distance provided by the user.

This application was developed using Java and Spring Web, and its operation is simple but efficient. The service is designed to assist users in locating Points of Interest (POIs)
based on GPS coordinates. By leveraging a database of predefined POIs, the system offers two key functionalities:
Registering Points of Interest: Users can add POIs to the database, each with three attributes: a name, and its X and Y coordinates (both non-negative integers).
Finding POIs by Proximity: Users can specify a reference point (X, Y) and a maximum distance (d-max) in meters. The system calculates the proximity of each POI from the reference point and returns those that are within the given distance.
